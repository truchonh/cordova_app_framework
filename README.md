# cordova_app_framework
Homemade framework / base for cordova mobile web apps

This framework is heavily based on the materilizecss lirary. It allows to build a simple app with views and components.

TODO:
- Find a way to package the whole framework with dependencies in a single js file
- Isolate most controllers into components (log, data, cache)
- Add offline mode as a module
